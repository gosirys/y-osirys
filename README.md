## Personal Site / CMS / 2010 Anno Domini

In late 2010 I wanted to build my own website and ended up developing this. It can almost  
be used as a CMS as most of the content is dynamically fetched from the database.

Developed in PHP, MySQL, Plain JavaScript.

## Status

This of course is discontinued, I just put it here because why not.  
Thanks to the development of this site I learned MySQL, JavaScript and PHP.  
So it more than served its purpose.

## Showcase / Preview
Below you can see how the main pages look like.
